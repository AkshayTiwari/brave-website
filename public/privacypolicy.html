<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<BR>

<h3>Our Policy</h3>
Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Brave Software, Inc. (“Brave”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”).

This Privacy Policy sets forth Brave’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.
</P><P>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below: </P><P>
<h3>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services</h3> 
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information through our website or when you contact us with inquiries through email, social media or similar channels.

If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Brave and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States. </strong></P><P><BR>
	<h2>Other Information</h2>
		<h3>Non-Identifiable Data</h3> 
    When you interact with Brave through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Brave may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Brave affiliates, agents or service providers. </P><P>

    <h3>Third Party Analytics</h3> 
    We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities on our Site (but not through the Browser generally). For example, we use a web analytics service provided by Chartbeat, Inc. (“Chartbeat”). Charbeat’s analytics services use cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site.

<h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
Brave uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Brave and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Brave and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.  </P><P>
If Brave intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected. 
</P><P>
<h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
Brave is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: 
</P><P>	
    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.  
</P><P>	<h3>Related Companies</h3>
    We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
	</P><P> 
    <h3>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</h3> 
    Brave, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.	
</P><P>	
    <h3>Legal Requirements</h3> 
    Brave may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Brave, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

</P><P>
<h3>Children</h3>
Brave does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Brave through the Services, please contact us at support@brave.com, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. 
</P><P>
<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>  
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Brave (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Brave endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies. 

</P><P>
<h3>Security</h3>
Brave takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Brave. 
</P><P>
<h3>Other Terms and Conditions</h3>
Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service at <a href="termsofuse.html">www.brave.com/ToU</a>.
</P><P>

The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Brave to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Brave reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically and Brave’s Twitter handle @Brave for information on updates, and especially before you provide any Personal Data.

</P><P>
