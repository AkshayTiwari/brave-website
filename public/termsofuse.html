Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</P>
                            
<h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
                                    
This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.”  You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Brave, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Brave are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</P>
<P>
<strong>YOU AND BRAVE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND BRAVE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  </strong></P>
<P>
    <h3>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
Brave is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@brave.com.  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).  The Notice to Brave should be sent to support@brave.com(“Notice Address”).  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  If Brave and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Brave may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Brave or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Brave is entitled.</P>
<P>
    <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless Brave and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Brave agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</P>

    <P>
<h3>Costs of Arbitration</h3>
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Brave will pay all Arbitration Fees.  If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Brave will pay your portion of such fees.  In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Brave will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</P>
<P>
<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</P>
            <P>
<h3>Severability</h3>
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than subsection (b) above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.  The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</P>
                <P>
<h3>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Brave agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Brave written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.</P>
                    <P>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
The Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and Brave with respect to the Service, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Brave with respect to the Service.  If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Brave shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder due to any cause beyond Brave’s reasonable control.  The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable or transferable by you except with Brave's prior written consent.  Brave may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or two days after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</P>
                        <P>

<h3>Copyright Dispute Policy</h3>
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked as set forth below (see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for further details).  It is Brave’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. The address of Brave’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (“Designated Agent”) is listed at the end of this policy.</P>
                            <P>
<strong>A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:  </strong>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Brave Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:  1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;                 2. Identification of works or materials being infringed; 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Brave is capable of finding and verifying its existence; 4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address; 5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</P>
                                <P>
<strong>B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent: </strong>It is Brave’s policy: 1. to remove or disable access to the infringing material; 2. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and 3. that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Brave will terminate such content provider’s, member’s or user’s access to the service.</P>
                                    <P>
<strong>C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent: </strong>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:  1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user; 2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; 3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and 4. Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located, or if the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Brave is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</P>
                                        <P>
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Brave’s may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Brave may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Brave’s discretion.</P><BR>
                                            <P>
