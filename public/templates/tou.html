THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE BRAVE WEB BROWSER AND ALL RELATED SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY FEATURES, CONTENT, WEBSITES (INCLUDING WWW.BRAVE.COM)  OR APPLICATIONS OFFERED FROM TIME TO TIME BY BRAVE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH (COLLECTIVELY &#8220;SERVICE(S)&#8221;).  BY USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

                    <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                    <p>The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of these Terms of Use and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time in connection with the Services by Brave.  In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Brave from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. </p> 
                    
                    <p>Brave may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.  This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>

                    <h3>Modification of Terms of Use</h3>
                    <p>Brave reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Brave websites or Service or by sending you an email.  Brave may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.  It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes.  Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

If you breach this Agreement, the above license and your right to use the Brave browser will terminate immediately and without notice.

                    <p>Further, you shall not (directly or indirectly): (i) take any action that imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Brave&#8217;s (or its third party providers&#8217;) infrastructure; or (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service; (iii) bypass any measures Brave may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service (or parts thereof).</p>
